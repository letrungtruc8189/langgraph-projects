# FlashTL;DR Extension - Development Constitution

## Core Principles

This constitution defines the fundamental principles and guidelines that govern the development, maintenance, and evolution of the FlashTL;DR extension. All development decisions should align with these principles.

### 1. Privacy First
**Principle**: User privacy and data ownership are paramount.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Never collect personal data without explicit user consent
- Process content locally whenever possible
- When external API calls are necessary, send only the minimum required data
- Provide clear, transparent privacy policies
- Give users control over their data (export, delete, manage)
- Default to the most privacy-preserving option

**Code Examples**:
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Minimal data sent to API
const summaryRequest = {
  text: extractedContent.text, // Only content text
  language: extractedContent.language,
  options: userOptions
};

// ❌ Bad: Sending unnecessary data
const summaryRequest = {
  text: extractedContent.text,
  url: extractedContent.url, // Not needed for summarization
  userAgent: navigator.userAgent, // Privacy violation
  timestamp: Date.now()
};
```

### 2. User Experience Excellence
**Principle**: The extension should be intuitive, fast, and delightful to use.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Prioritize speed and responsiveness in all interactions
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Design for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Minimize cognitive load with simple, clean interfaces
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Support keyboard navigation and shortcuts

**Performance Targets**:
- Content extraction: <500ms for 90% of pages
- UI responsiveness: <100ms for all interactions
- Memory usage: <50MB total
- Extension load time: <2s

### 3. Reliability and Robustness
**Principle**: The extension should work consistently across diverse websites and conditions.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Provide fallback strategies for all critical functions
- Test on a wide variety of websites and layouts
- Handle network failures and API limitations gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

**Reliability Standards**:
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling
async function extractContent(): Promise<ExtractedContent> {
  try {
    // Primary extraction method
    return await primaryExtraction();
  } catch (primaryError) {
    console.warn('Primary extraction failed, trying fallback');
    try {
      // Fallback extraction method
      return await fallbackExtraction();
    } catch (fallbackError) {
      // Final fallback with minimal content
      return createMinimalContent();
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Security by Design
**Principle**: Security considerations must be integrated into every aspect of development.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Follow Chrome extension security best practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure storage for sensitive data (API keys)
- Implement Content Security Policy compliance
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
- Principle of least privilege for permissions

**Security Checklist**:
- [ ] No eval() or unsafe code execution
- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] Secure API key storage and transmission
- [ ] CSP compliance verified
- [ ] Dependency security audit completed

### 5. Multilingual Excellence
**Principle**: The extension should provide native-quality experience across languages.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Implement robust language detection
- Use language-specific AI prompts and terminology
- Support right-to-left languages properly
- Provide culturally appropriate tone and formatting
- Test with native speakers when possible
- Default to user's browser language when appropriate

**Language Support Standards**:
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Language-specific prompts
const prompts = {
  vi: {
    system: "Bạn là một chuyên gia tóm tắt nội dung chính xác...",
    terminology: { tldr: "Tóm tắt", bullets: "Điểm chính" }
  },
  en: {
    system: "You are a precise content summarizer...",
    terminology: { tldr: "TL;DR", bullets: "Key Points" }
  }
};
```

### 6. Maintainable Architecture
**Principle**: Code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Use TypeScript with strict mode for type safety
- Follow consistent naming conventions and code style
- Write comprehensive documentation and comments
- Implement modular, testable architecture
- Use dependency injection for better testing
- Regular refactoring to reduce technical debt

**Code Quality Standards**:
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Well-documented, typed interface
interface ContentExtractor {
  /**
   * Extracts main content from a webpage
   * @param document - The DOM document to extract from
   * @returns Promise resolving to extracted content with metadata
   * @throws ExtractionError when content cannot be extracted
   */
  extractContent(document: Document): Promise<ExtractedContent>;
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards

#### TypeScript Usage
- Use strict mode with all type checking enabled
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Implement proper error types with discriminated unions

#### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `content-extractor.ts`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `ContentExtractor`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `extractContent`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`)
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `ExtractedContent`)

#### Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must have JSDoc comments
- Complex algorithms require inline comments
- README files for each major component
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes

### Testing Philosophy

#### Testing Pyramid
1. **Unit Tests**: Core logic and utilities (70%)
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions (20%)
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Full user workflows (10%)

#### Testing Standards
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive test coverage
describe('ContentExtractor', () => {
  describe('extractContent', () => {
    it('should extract content from semantic HTML', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should handle extraction failures gracefully', async () => {
      // Error handling test
    });
    
    it('should detect language correctly', async () => {
      // Language detection test
    });
  });
});
```

### Performance Guidelines

#### Optimization Priorities
1. **User-Perceived Performance**: UI responsiveness
2. **Content Extraction Speed**: Fast DOM processing
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint
4. **Network Optimization**: Efficient API usage

#### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Performance measurement for critical paths
class PerformanceTracker {
  static async measureAsync<T>(
    operation: string,
    fn: () => Promise<T>
  ): Promise<T> {
    const start = performance.now();
    try {
      const result = await fn();
      const duration = performance.now() - start;
      console.log(`[Performance] ${operation}: ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      const duration = performance.now() - start;
      console.error(`[Performance] ${operation} failed after ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
