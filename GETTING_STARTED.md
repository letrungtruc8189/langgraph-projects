## üöÄ The 3-Phase Workflow in 60 Seconds

### Phase 1: Research (15-30 min)
**What**: Explore technologies, architectures, and make decisions  
**Output**: `research.md` with chosen tech stack and rationale  
**Key**: Document WHY you chose each technology

### Phase 2: Specification (30-60 min)
**What**: Write detailed requirements and technical plan  
**Output**: `spec.md` (requirements) + `plan.md` (technical details)  
**Key**: Be specific and measurable

### Phase 3: Implementation (varies)
**What**: Break down into tasks and build  
**Output**: `tasks.md` + working code  
**Key**: Small tasks, test as you go

## üé¨ Your First Project: Step-by-Step

### Option A: With AI Assistant (Recommended)

**1. Tell the AI what you want to build**
```
"I want to build a todo list app with Next.js"
```

**2. AI will start Phase 1 (Research)**
- Researches tech options
- Creates `research.md`
- Explains decisions
- Asks for your approval

**3. Review and approve**
```
"Looks good, proceed to Phase 2"
```

**4. AI creates Phase 2 (Specifications)**
- Creates `spec.md` with requirements
- Creates `plan.md` with technical details
- Shows you the plan

**5. Review and approve**
```
"Great! Let's move to implementation"
```

**6. AI creates Phase 3 (Tasks) and implements**
- Breaks down into tasks
- Creates todos
- Implements step by step
- Shows progress

**7. Review and test**
- AI shows what was built
- You test the features
- Iterate if needed

---

### Option B: Manual Process

**1. Copy template**
```bash
cp -r _templates/new-project/ ./my-todo-app/
cd my-todo-app
```

**2. Fill out Phase 1 (research.md)**
- Research 2-3 technology options
- Document pros/cons
- Choose your stack
- Explain why

**3. Create Phase 2 (spec.md + plan.md)**
- List all features (Functional Requirements)
- Write user stories
- Document architecture
- Define API and data models

**4. Create Phase 3 (tasks.md)**
- Break features into tasks
- Define acceptance criteria
- List dependencies
- Estimate complexity

**5. Implement with AI assistance**
```
"Help me implement Task 1 from my tasks.md"
```

---

## üí° Example: Building a Blog

### Phase 1: Research

**You tell AI**:
```
"I want to build a blog with markdown posts and a reading list"
```

**AI researches and suggests**:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- MDX for posts
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vercel for hosting

**Creates**: `specs/001-blog-mvp/research.md`

### Phase 2: Specification

**AI creates spec.md with**:
- FR1: Post Management (CRUD)
- FR2: Markdown Rendering
- FR3: Reading List
- User Stories for readers and authors
- Performance requirements

**AI creates plan.md with**:
- Architecture diagram
- File structure
- Component design
- API routes
- Deployment strategy

### Phase 3: Tasks

**AI breaks down into 20 tasks**:
- Tasks 1-5: Setup (Next.js, Tailwind, MDX)
- Tasks 6-12: Core features (Posts, Reading)
- Tasks 13-16: Polish (SEO, Performance)
- Tasks 17-20: Testing & Deployment

**Then implements systematically**

---

## üîÑ Adding to Existing Projects

### Example: Add Comments to Blog

**1. Tell AI**:
```
"Add a comment system to my blog"
```

**2. AI starts Phase 1 (Analysis)**:
- Analyzes existing codebase
- Finds integration points
- Suggests approach
- Documents affected files

**3. Phase 2 (Specification)**:
- Documents comment requirements
- Shows how it integrates
- Plans data model changes
- Defines API endpoints

**4. Phase 3 (Implementation)**:
- Creates detailed tasks
- References existing code
- Implements changes
- Runs tests

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

1. **Be Specific**: "Build a todo app with user auth and due dates"
2. **Review Each Phase**: Check research before specs, specs before code
3. **Trust the Process**: Let each phase complete fully
4. **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, ask AI to explain
5. **Iterate**: It's okay to go back and refine

### Don'ts ‚ùå

1. **Don't Skip Research**: Jumping to code leads to poor decisions
2. **Don't Rush Specs**: Good specs = faster development
3. **Don't Ignore Integration**: For existing projects, analyze first
4. **Don't Make Assumptions**: Ask if requirements are unclear
5. **Don't Skip Testing**: Test as you build, not at the end

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Working with AI Effectively

### Give Good Context

**‚ùå Bad**:
```
"Build an app"
```

**‚úÖ Good**:
```
"Build a todo app where users can:
- Create tasks with due dates
- Mark tasks as complete
- Filter by status
- User authentication required"
```

### Review and Approve Each Phase

**AI will ask**:
```
"I've completed Phase 1 research. 
I recommend Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL.
Should I proceed to Phase 2?"
```

**You review and respond**:
```
"Yes, but use SQLite instead of PostgreSQL"
```

### Ask for Clarification

**If something is unclear**:
```
"Why did you choose X over Y?"
"Can you explain the architecture diagram?"
"What are the trade-offs of this approach?"
```

## üìñ Learning from Examples

### Study the Example Project

The `flash-tldr-extension` is a complete example:

1. **Check the specs**: See how requirements are documented
   - [spec.md](./flash-tldr-extension/specs/001-flash-tldr-extension/spec.md)
   - [plan.md](./flash-tldr-extension/specs/001-flash-tldr-extension/plan.md)

2. **Read the constitution**: See development principles
   - [constitution.md](./flash-tldr-extension/memory/constitution.md)

3. **Explore the code**: See how it's structured
   - Look at folder organization
   - Check how files are named
   - See testing approach

---

## üéì Next Steps

### Once You're Comfortable

1. **Create Your First Project**
   - Start small (todo app, note-taking, calculator)
   - Follow the 3-phase process
   - Complete one feature fully

2. **Add a Feature to Existing Project**
   - Choose flash-tldr-extension or your own
   - Follow the enhancement workflow
   - See how integration works

3. **Experiment with Tech Stacks**
   - Try different frameworks
   - Compare approaches
   - Document learnings

4. **Create Your Own Constitution**
   - Define your coding standards
   - Document your preferences
   - Build your style guide

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### AI Skips Research Phase

**Problem**: AI jumps straight to implementation

**Solution**: Explicitly say:
```
"Let's start with Phase 1 research first. 
Please explore technology options and create research.md"
```

### Specs Are Too Vague

**Problem**: Requirements lack detail

**Solution**: Ask for more specifics:
```
"Can you add more detailed acceptance criteria?"
"What about error cases and edge cases?"
"Can you add more user stories?"
```

### Tasks Are Too Large

**Problem**: Tasks are not actionable

**Solution**: Request breakdown:
```
"Can you break Task 5 into smaller subtasks?"
"This task seems too large, can you split it?"
```

### Lost Track of Progress

**Problem**: Not sure what's done

**Solution**: Ask for status:
```
"Can you show me which tasks are completed?"
"What phase are we in?"
"What's left to do?"
```
