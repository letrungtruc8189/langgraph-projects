## 🎯 The 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Exploration & Research (15-30 min)
**Goal**: Understand problem space and technology decisions

**For New Projects**:
- Research technology options (≥3 options)
- Evaluate architecture patterns
- Document decisions with rationale
- Use MCP tools for documentation

**For Existing Projects**:
- Analyze existing codebase
- Identify integration points
- Document affected components
- Plan compatibility strategy

**Output**: `specs/001-name/research.md`

---

### Phase 2: Specification & PRD (30-60 min)
**Goal**: Create comprehensive requirements and technical plan

**Documents to Create**:
- `spec.md` - Product Requirements Document
  - Functional requirements (FR1, FR2, ...)
  - User stories with acceptance criteria
  - Non-functional requirements (NFR1, NFR2, ...)
  - Success metrics
  
- `plan.md` - Technical Implementation Plan
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Technology stack details
  - Data flow and APIs
  - Security and performance
  - Testing and deployment strategy

**Optional**:
- `data-model.md` - Data structures
- `contracts/api-contracts.md` - API specifications

---

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown & Implementation (15-30 min + dev time)
**Goal**: Create actionable tasks and implement

**Process**:
1. Create `tasks.md` with detailed task breakdown
2. Organize tasks into phases
3. Define dependencies and acceptance criteria
4. Use `todo_write` tool to track progress
5. Implement systematically
6. Test as you build

## 💡 How to Use This Workspace

### For New Projects

**Quick Start**:
```
Tell AI: "Create a new project called 'my-app' for [description]"
```

AI will:
1. Use template structure
2. Guide through Phase 1 (Research)
3. Create Phase 2 (Specifications)
4. Break down Phase 3 (Tasks)
5. Implement systematically

**Manual Start**:
```bash
cp -r _templates/new-project/ ./my-app/
cd my-app
# Follow 3-phase process
```

### For Existing Projects

**Adding Features**:
```
Tell AI: "Add [feature] to [existing-project]"
```

AI will:
1. Analyze existing codebase (Phase 1)
2. Document integration points (Phase 2)
3. Create detailed tasks (Phase 3)
4. Implement with compatibility in mind

## ✨ What Makes This Different

### Traditional Approach
```
User: "Build X"
AI: [Jumps to code]
Result: May work, but lacks planning, documentation, maintainability
```

### This Workspace Approach
```
User: "Build X"
AI: Phase 1 → Research options, document decisions
    Phase 2 → Create specs and technical plan
    Phase 3 → Break down tasks, implement systematically
Result: Well-planned, documented, maintainable application
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Better technology decisions (researched)
- ✅ Clear requirements (documented)
- ✅ Maintainable code (planned architecture)
- ✅ Faster development (fewer rewrites)
- ✅ Easy onboarding (comprehensive docs)
- ✅ Quality assurance (built-in gates)
