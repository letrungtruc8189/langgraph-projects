# MCP Servers for Vibe Coding with LangGraph

## 🎯 **Perfect for Vibe Coding AI Agentic Systems**

Your MCP configuration is now set up with these vibe-coding-friendly servers:

### **Core Vibe Coding Tools**

1. **Filesystem MCP** 📁
   - **What it does**: AI can read/write files in your project
   - **Vibe benefit**: "Create a new agent file" → Done instantly
   - **Perfect for**: Rapid prototyping of agent components

2. **Memory MCP** 🧠
   - **What it does**: Persistent memory across sessions
   - **Vibe benefit**: AI remembers your coding patterns and preferences
   - **Perfect for**: Building context-aware agents

3. **Brave Search MCP** 🔍
   - **What it does**: Real-time web search during development
   - **Vibe benefit**: "Find the latest LangGraph examples" → Instant results
   - **Perfect for**: Research and staying updated

4. **Postgres MCP** 🗄️
   - **What it does**: Direct database operations
   - **Vibe benefit**: "Store agent state in database" → Natural language to SQL
   - **Perfect for**: Persistent agent memory and state management

5. **GitHub MCP** 🐙
   - **What it does**: Repository operations and code search
   - **Vibe benefit**: "Find similar agent implementations" → Code examples
   - **Perfect for**: Learning from existing agent patterns

6. **Context7 MCP** 📚
   - **What it does**: Up-to-date library documentation and code examples
   - **Vibe benefit**: "Show me LangGraph examples" → Latest docs and code
   - **Perfect for**: Staying current with library updates and best practices
   - **Setup**: Uses HTTP endpoint (no local installation needed)

## 🚀 **Vibe Coding Workflow**

### **1. Natural Language Planning**
```
You: "I want to build a customer support agent that can handle tickets and escalate complex issues"

AI + MCP: 
- Uses Memory MCP to remember your preferences
- Uses Brave Search to find latest customer support patterns
- Uses GitHub MCP to find similar implementations
- Uses Filesystem MCP to create the agent structure
```

### **2. Rapid Prototyping**
```
You: "Add a sentiment analysis node to the agent"

AI + MCP:
- Uses Filesystem MCP to modify your LangGraph
- Uses Memory MCP to remember your coding style
- Uses Postgres MCP to set up data storage if needed
```

### **3. Context-Aware Development**
```
You: "The agent should remember previous conversations"

AI + MCP:
- Uses Memory MCP to implement conversation memory
- Uses Postgres MCP to set up persistent storage
- Uses Filesystem MCP to create memory management utilities
```

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

1. **Copy environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys
   ```

2. **Restart Cursor** to load the MCP servers

3. **Start vibe coding**! Just describe what you want to build

## 💡 **Vibe Coding Tips**

- **Be descriptive**: "Create a multi-agent system for e-commerce" vs "make agents"
- **Think in flows**: Describe the agent workflow naturally
- **Iterate quickly**: Use MCP tools to rapidly prototype and test
- **Stay in flow**: Let the AI handle boilerplate while you focus on logic

## 🎨 **Example Vibe Coding Session**

```
You: "I want to build a research agent that can search the web, analyze documents, and generate reports"

AI + MCP Response:
- Uses Brave Search MCP to find research methodologies
- Uses Filesystem MCP to create agent structure
- Uses Memory MCP to set up knowledge retention
- Uses Postgres MCP to create report storage
- Generates LangGraph workflow with web search, analysis, and report generation nodes
```

## 🆕 **Context7 MCP Server Added!**

**Context7** is now integrated into your vibe coding setup! This powerful MCP server provides:

- **Up-to-date documentation** for any library or framework
- **Code examples** and best practices
- **API references** directly in your development flow
- **Version-specific information** to keep you current

### **Example Context7 Usage:**
```
You: "Show me the latest LangGraph StateGraph examples"

Context7 MCP Response:
- Fetches latest LangGraph documentation
- Provides current StateGraph API examples
