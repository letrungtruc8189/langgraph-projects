## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This

- [ ] ‚ùå Skip research and jump to code
- [ ] ‚ùå Choose technologies without justification
- [ ] ‚ùå Write vague requirements ("should be fast")
- [ ] ‚ùå Create large, unclear tasks
- [ ] ‚ùå Forget to document decisions
- [ ] ‚ùå Skip testing until the end
- [ ] ‚ùå Ignore existing project patterns
- [ ] ‚ùå Make assumptions without asking
- [ ] ‚ùå Start implementation without specs
- [ ] ‚ùå Forget to update todos

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead

- [ ] ‚úÖ Always start with research phase
- [ ] ‚úÖ Document all technology decisions
- [ ] ‚úÖ Write specific, measurable requirements
- [ ] ‚úÖ Break tasks into small, clear steps
- [ ] ‚úÖ Explain the "why" for decisions
- [ ] ‚úÖ Test as you build features
- [ ] ‚úÖ Follow existing project conventions
- [ ] ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions
- [ ] ‚úÖ Complete specs before coding
- [ ] ‚úÖ Keep todos current
